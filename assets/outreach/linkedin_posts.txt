## POST 3: Detailed Technical Post (For developer audience)

🚀 Announcing: AI Desktop Assistant v1.0.1

I've spent months building an open-source voice-controlled AI assistant that runs 100% offline.

**The Problem:**
Existing voice assistants require cloud connections, send your data to servers, and break without self-recovery.

**My Solution:**
✅ 100% offline operation
✅ Local LLM (Ollama/Mistral/LLaMA)
✅ Whisper for speech recognition
✅ Self-healing with Git rollback
✅ Desktop automation (browser, apps)

**Architecture:**
```
Voice → Whisper (GPU) → LLM (Ollama) → Action
                ↓
        Self-Healing Watchdog
                ↓
        Git-Backed Rollback
```

**GitHub:** https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant

I'm looking for opportunities in AI/ML, developer tools, or platform engineering. Companies I'd love to work with:
• USA: Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, NVIDIA, GitHub
• Singapore: Grab, GovTech, Sea Group
• Dubai: G42, Careem, Dubai Future Foundation
