Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Demo from Bedanta Chatterjee

---

Hi,

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — maintainer of AI Desktop Assistant, an open-source voice-controlled desktop automation tool.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
📦 Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

**What it does:**
• Offline-first desktop assistant (voice input → LLM → automation)
• Uses faster-whisper for GPU-accelerated speech recognition
• Local LLM support via Ollama — works with HuggingFace models
• Self-healing system with Git-backed error recovery

**Why this matters for Hugging Face:**
This project showcases practical deployment of open-source ML models (Whisper, Mistral, LLaMA) in a desktop application. It demonstrates the real-world value of the open-source ML ecosystem — perfectly aligned with HuggingFace's mission.

**Ask:**
Would you be open to a 20-minute live demo? I'd love to show how open-source models power this entire application and discuss potential integrations.

Best regards,
Bedanta Chatterjee
