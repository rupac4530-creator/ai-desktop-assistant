Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Demo from Bedanta Chatterjee

---

Hi,

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — maintainer of AI Desktop Assistant, an open-source voice-controlled desktop automation tool.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
📦 Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

**What it does:**
• Offline-first desktop assistant (voice input → LLM → automation)
• Local LLM support via Ollama (works with LLaMA models)
• Self-healing system with Git-backed error recovery
• GPU-accelerated speech recognition (Whisper/faster-whisper)

**Why this matters for Meta:**
This project uses LLaMA-compatible models and demonstrates practical on-device AI deployment. The privacy-first architecture aligns with Meta's focus on on-device AI and could interest the AI Research and Reality Labs teams.

**Ask:**
Would you be open to a 20-minute live demo? I can show how the assistant runs LLaMA models locally with voice control and self-healing automation.

Best regards,
Bedanta Chatterjee
