Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Demo from Bedanta Chatterjee

---

Hi,

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — maintainer of AI Desktop Assistant, an open-source voice-controlled desktop automation tool.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
📦 Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

**What it does:**
• Offline-first desktop assistant (voice input → LLM → automation)
• Local LLM support via Ollama — 100% private, no cloud required
• Self-healing system with Git-backed error recovery
• GPU-accelerated speech recognition (Whisper/faster-whisper)

**Why this matters for G42:**
As the UAE's leading AI company, G42 is building cutting-edge AI infrastructure. This project demonstrates practical local LLM deployment with privacy-first architecture and self-healing patterns — relevant to your AI Cloud and enterprise solutions.

**Ask:**
Would you be open to a 20-minute live demo? I can show how the assistant:
- Runs entirely offline with zero cloud dependencies
- Executes multi-step automation via local LLM
- Self-heals errors using Git-backed rollback

I'm based in India and happy to schedule a call at a convenient time for Abu Dhabi.

Best regards,
Bedanta Chatterjee
