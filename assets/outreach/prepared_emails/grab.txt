Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Demo from Bedanta Chatterjee

---

Hi,

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — maintainer of AI Desktop Assistant, an open-source voice-controlled desktop automation tool.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
📦 Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

**What it does:**
• Offline-first desktop assistant (voice input → LLM → automation)
• Local LLM support via Ollama — no cloud required
• Self-healing system with Git-backed error recovery
• GPU-accelerated speech recognition (Whisper/faster-whisper)

**Why this matters for Grab:**
As Southeast Asia's leading super app, Grab handles complex multi-service orchestration. This project demonstrates self-healing automation patterns and resilient system design — relevant to your platform engineering and internal tooling teams.

**Ask:**
Would you be open to a 20-minute live demo? I can show how the assistant:
- Orchestrates multi-step automation reliably
- Recovers from errors automatically
- Runs voice interfaces with low latency

I'm based in India (same timezone region) and happy to schedule a convenient call.

Best regards,
Bedanta Chatterjee
