Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Demo from Bedanta Chatterjee

---

Hi,

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — maintainer of AI Desktop Assistant, an open-source voice-controlled desktop automation tool.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
📦 Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

**What it does:**
• Offline-first desktop assistant (voice input → LLM → automation)
• Local LLM support via Ollama (Mistral, LLaMA) — no cloud required
• Self-healing system with Git-backed error recovery
• GPU-accelerated speech recognition (Whisper/faster-whisper)

**Why this matters for Microsoft:**
This project aligns with Microsoft's focus on AI-powered developer tools (GitHub Copilot, VS Code, Azure AI). The offline-first architecture and self-healing patterns could be valuable for Windows platform teams and Azure AI services.

**Ask:**
Would you be open to a 20-minute live demo? I can show how the assistant:
- Transcribes voice commands in real-time
- Executes multi-step browser and desktop automation
- Recovers from errors automatically using Git rollback

I can also send a 90-second recorded demo and one-pager PDF if you prefer.

Best regards,
Bedanta Chatterjee
