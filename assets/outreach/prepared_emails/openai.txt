Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Demo from Bedanta Chatterjee

---

Hi,

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — maintainer of AI Desktop Assistant, an open-source voice-controlled desktop automation tool.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
📦 Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

**What it does:**
• Offline-first desktop assistant (voice input → LLM → automation)
• Local LLM support via Ollama (Mistral, LLaMA) — works with any LLM
• Self-healing system with Git-backed error recovery
• GPU-accelerated speech recognition using Whisper (your model!)

**Why this matters for OpenAI:**
This project uses Whisper for speech recognition and demonstrates practical LLM integration for desktop automation. The self-healing architecture shows novel approaches to building resilient AI agents — relevant to OpenAI's work on reliable AI systems.

**Ask:**
Would you be open to a 20-minute live demo? I can show how the assistant:
- Uses Whisper for real-time transcription
- Executes multi-step automation via LLM reasoning
- Recovers from errors automatically

I can also send a 90-second recorded demo and one-pager PDF if you prefer.

Best regards,
Bedanta Chatterjee
