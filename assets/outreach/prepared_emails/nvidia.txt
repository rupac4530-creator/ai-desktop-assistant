Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Demo from Bedanta Chatterjee

---

Hi,

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — maintainer of AI Desktop Assistant, an open-source voice-controlled desktop automation tool.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
📦 Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

**What it does:**
• Offline-first desktop assistant (voice input → LLM → automation)
• CUDA-accelerated Whisper inference for real-time speech recognition
• Local LLM support via Ollama — optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
• Self-healing system with Git-backed error recovery

**Why this matters for NVIDIA:**
This project showcases CUDA-accelerated AI inference on consumer GPUs (RTX 4050). It demonstrates practical GPU utilization for speech recognition and LLM workloads — relevant to NVIDIA's AI platform, developer tools, and edge computing initiatives.

**Ask:**
Would you be open to a 20-minute live demo? I can show how the assistant:
- Runs Whisper at 10x realtime on RTX GPU
- Executes local LLM inference with Ollama
- Handles GPU memory efficiently for multi-model workloads

I can also send a 90-second recorded demo and one-pager PDF if you prefer.

Best regards,
Bedanta Chatterjee
