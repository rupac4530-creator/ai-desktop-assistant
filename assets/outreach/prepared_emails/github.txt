Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Demo from Bedanta Chatterjee

---

Hi,

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — maintainer of AI Desktop Assistant, an open-source voice-controlled desktop automation tool.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
📦 Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

**What it does:**
• Offline-first desktop assistant (voice input → LLM → automation)
• Git-backed self-healing with automatic rollback on errors
• Local LLM support via Ollama — no cloud required
• GPU-accelerated speech recognition (Whisper/faster-whisper)

**Why this matters for GitHub:**
This project demonstrates novel use of Git for self-healing automation — the assistant commits before changes and rolls back on failure. This pattern could inspire GitHub Copilot and Actions features. The entire project follows GitHub community best practices.

**Ask:**
Would you be open to a 20-minute live demo? I'd love to show the Git-backed self-healing system and discuss how this approach could benefit developer tools.

Best regards,
Bedanta Chatterjee
