Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Demo from Bedanta Chatterjee

---

Hi,

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee — maintainer of AI Desktop Assistant, an open-source voice-controlled desktop automation tool.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
📦 Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

**What it does:**
• Offline-first desktop assistant (voice input → LLM → automation)
• Local LLM support via Ollama — 100% private, no cloud required
• Self-healing system with Git-backed error recovery
• GPU-accelerated speech recognition (Whisper/faster-whisper)

**Why this matters:**
This project demonstrates practical AI application development combining speech recognition, LLM reasoning, and desktop automation — all running locally with production-grade error handling.

**Tech Stack:**
Python • faster-whisper • Ollama • CUDA • pyttsx3 • PyAutoGUI

**Ask:**
Would you be open to a 20-minute live demo? I can show:
- Real-time voice-to-action pipeline
- Self-healing automation with Git rollback
- Local LLM inference without cloud dependencies

I can also send a 90-second recorded demo and one-pager PDF if you prefer.

Best regards,
Bedanta Chatterjee
