### Template 1: Full Pitch

Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Quick Demo?

Hi {Name},

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee, maintainer of AI Desktop Assistant — an open-source voice-controlled desktop assistant that runs 100% locally.

**Quick summary:**
• Voice control via Whisper (GPU-accelerated)
• Local LLM (Ollama/Mistral) — no cloud required
• Self-healing system with Git-backed rollback
• Desktop automation (browser, apps)

**GitHub:** https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant

I think this could be relevant to {Company}'s work on {AI/developer tools/platform}. Would you be open to a 15-20 minute demo call next week?

If easier, I can send a 90-second video walkthrough first.

Thanks,
Bedanta

### Template 2: Short & Casual

Hi {Name},

I built an open-source AI desktop assistant that runs completely offline (voice + LLM + automation). Thought it might interest you given your work at {Company}.

Here's the repo: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant

Would love to chat if you're curious — happy to do a quick demo!

Cheers,
Bedanta

## USAGE TIPS

1. **Personalize every message** — mention something specific about them or their company
2. **Don't mass-send** — LinkedIn flags spam; send 5-10 requests per day max
3. **Wait 3-5 days** before following up on connection requests
4. **If rejected**, don't re-request; move on
5. **Track in spreadsheet** — who you messaged, when, response status
