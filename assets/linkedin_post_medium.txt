🎙️ I built something I'm really proud of: AI Desktop Assistant v1.0.1

After months of development, I'm excited to share my open-source voice-controlled AI assistant that runs 100% locally on your machine.

🔑 Key Features:
• Voice control via Whisper (GPU-accelerated)
• Local LLM integration — no API keys, no cloud
• Self-healing system that auto-repairs errors
• Complete privacy — zero data leaves your machine

💻 Tech Stack:
Python • faster-whisper • Ollama • CUDA • pyttsx3 • PyAutoGUI

🛠️ What makes it different:
Unlike Alexa or Siri, this assistant doesn't send your voice to the cloud. Everything — speech recognition, AI reasoning, and text-to-speech — happens on YOUR computer.
