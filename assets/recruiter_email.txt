Subject: AI Desktop Assistant (open-source) â€” Bedanta Chatterjee â€” available for roles

Hi [Name],

My name is Bedanta Chatterjee. I recently built and open-sourced an AI Desktop Assistant (Python). Itâ€™s an autonomous, self-healing assistant with offline-first LLM integration, voice commands (PTT), TTS, OCR and Git-backed autonomous repair. Itâ€™s packaged with docs and a release:

GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant.git
Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant.git/releases/tag/v1.0.1

Iâ€™m actively looking for roles in AI tooling, automation, or developer experience. Iâ€™d appreciate a chance to interview or demonstrate the project.

Thanks,
Bedanta Chatterjee
