Subject: Open-Source AI Developer — Bedanta Chatterjee — Available for Roles

Hi [Name],

My name is Bedanta Chatterjee. I recently built and open-sourced an AI Desktop Assistant (Python).

It is an autonomous, self-healing assistant with:
- Offline-first LLM integration (Ollama)
- Voice commands (push-to-talk with Whisper)
- Text-to-speech
- OCR and screen reading
- Git-backed autonomous repair

GitHub: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
Release: https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

I am actively looking for roles in AI tooling, automation, or developer experience. I would appreciate a chance to interview or demonstrate the project.

Thanks,
Bedanta Chatterjee
