🚀 Announcing: AI Desktop Assistant v1.0.1

I've been working on this project for several months, and I'm thrilled to finally share it with the world.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐭?
A fully autonomous, voice-controlled AI desktop assistant that runs 100% locally. No cloud. No subscriptions. No data leaving your machine.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐈 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬:
I was frustrated with existing voice assistants that:
❌ Require internet for basic tasks
❌ Send your voice recordings to remote servers
❌ Need expensive API subscriptions
❌ Break and stay broken

So I built one that:
✅ Works completely offline
✅ Keeps all data on your machine
✅ Uses free, open-source models
✅ Self-heals when something breaks
