## Tips for Best Recording

1. Use a quiet room (Whisper works better)
2. Speak clearly and at normal pace
3. Wait for each action to complete before speaking again
4. Keep mouse movements slow and deliberate
5. Use 1920x1080 resolution for crisp GIFs
6. Close unnecessary applications to avoid distractions
