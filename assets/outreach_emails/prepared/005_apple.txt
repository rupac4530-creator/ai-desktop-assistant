Subject: Open-Source AI Desktop Assistant — Demo Available | Bedanta Chatterjee
---
Hi Emily Davis,

I'm Bedanta Chatterjee, a developer from India. I recently released **AI Desktop Assistant v1.0.1** — a production-ready, open-source voice assistant that runs 100% locally with zero cloud dependencies.

**What makes it unique:**
• Voice control via Whisper (GPU-accelerated)
• Local LLM integration (Ollama/Mistral) — no API keys needed
• Self-healing system that auto-repairs errors using Git
• Complete privacy — no data leaves the machine

**Tech Stack:** Python, faster-whisper, Ollama, CUDA, pyttsx3, PyAutoGUI

🔗 **GitHub:** https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant
📦 **Release:** https://github.com/rupac4530-creator/ai-desktop-assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1

I'd love to schedule a **20-minute demo** to show how this project demonstrates:
- End-to-end system architecture
- Real-time audio/AI pipeline design
- Production-grade error handling & self-healing

Are you available next week for a quick call?

Best regards,
**Bedanta Chatterjee**
